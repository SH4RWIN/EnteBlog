So most people think it is so hard to start going to the gym or keep eating a healthy diet, And trust me from experience I also used to think it was super hard. It all started when I heard this from David Goggins:
| When you feel like quiting, you've only reached 40% of your actual capability.

## How that hit me
It felt like a bomb going off in my head, And I started remembering the times that I was able to do that.
There was a time I was in a competition where we had to do planks and the last standing wins. Usually I could plank for around 3 minutes max and then I would fall off. But on that day, when there was competition, people cheering for us, I felt it that competitive energy buildup. All the power that hid in the body started coming out at minute 3. By minute 5 I felt like giving up, my body started saying "No you can't do this you've only maxed out on 3 minutes, you're done dude, just fall down", And thats when Goggins appeared in my mind. And He started calling me a fucking pussy if I stopped and quit. And then came the quote: 
" You have only reached 40 % And after 40 percent its all a mind game ". Now that fueled me to go for 2 more minutes. **Thats a total of 7 minutes of planking**.

Here's the reality: You never know how much potential you have without going full in, you need to be able to push beyond the boundaries you have set for yourself. Thats how you level up. And that was the day David Goggins proved me You only reach 40%.
